HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Sparks: purpose, creativity, ambition, dharma.
2) Add Two (Choices): intuition will guide the way.
3) Translate: there are two viable directions—one likely feels safer, the other more alive.
4) Practical step: choose a decision filter (values, energy, long-term fit) and pick one direction to test.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Sparks domain.
2) Use Two (Reversed): indecision; blocking the path’s potential.
3) Name the friction: fear of choosing wrong, trying to please everyone, wanting both paths at once.
4) Correction: decide a short “trial period” for one option and commit long enough to gather evidence.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: crossroads clarity; choosing the path that matches your calling; confident direction.
- Challenging: analysis paralysis; splitting energy; delaying action until “perfect certainty.”

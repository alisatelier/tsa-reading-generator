KNOWLEDGE TYPE: pip_archetype
PIP: Two

CORE THEME:
- Choice, contrast, duality.
- A fork in the road; two truths can exist at once.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Choices; intuition will guide the way.
- Balancing two options, two needs, or two perspectives.
- Partnership energy can show up: agreements, alignment, “how we do this together.”

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- The answer often isn’t “either/or” forever—sometimes it’s “which first?”
- Ask: Which option aligns with my values? Which aligns with my nervous system?
- Make space for discernment; don’t rush.

REVERSED MEANING:
- Indecision; blocking the path’s potential.
- Avoidance, paralysis, conflicting priorities, or refusing to choose.
- Sometimes: too many inputs, not enough inner listening.

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Decide what you need to know, and how you’ll get it.
- Set a decision deadline.
- Ask: What am I afraid I’ll lose if I choose?

MICRO-ACTION:
- Write Option A / Option B; list one cost + one benefit for each, then pick the “first step” path.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- If I trusted my intuition completely, what would I choose first—and why?

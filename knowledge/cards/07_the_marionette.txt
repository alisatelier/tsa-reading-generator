CARD ID: 7
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): The Marionette
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): The Chariot
ELEMENT: Water

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "The Marionette" (never call it "The Chariot").
- You may use traditional Chariot symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "The Marionette".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Taking command of your direction.
- Willpower and coordinated movement.
- Maintaining control of many moving parts.
- Action despite uncertainty; steering your life with intention.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Like The Marionette, your every movement tugs at the cosmic cords of The Fates. When every cause is accompanied by an equal yet unknowable effect, it can feel challenging to risk action against obscurity. The Marionette asks you to take command as the puppetmaster of your life and put on the show of your destiny. By orchestrating the cosmic cords, you now have control. Be calculated in your flourishes, for The Fates are still in audience.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Tripping up; lack of coordination.
- Paralysis: too many variables, not enough traction.
- Unfavourable cascades: small missteps causing outsized consequences.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When The Marionette appears reversed, the cords may feel tangled. You might be trying to steer too many moving parts at once, or waiting for certainty that won’t arrive. This is a call to simplify the show: choose one clear direction, set one steady rhythm, and release what you cannot control. Momentum returns when your actions become consistent, not frantic.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- You’re being asked to choose a direction and commit.
- Coordination matters: timing, planning, follow-through.
- The lesson is disciplined movement: steering your life instead of being pulled by circumstance.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Name the destination: “What am I moving toward?”
- Pick one next step that is measurable and time-bound.
- Reduce variables: delegate, postpone, or drop one moving part.

KEYWORDS / TAGS:
- direction, willpower, momentum, control, coordination, commitment, disciplined action, steering, destiny

ALIAS / SEARCH HELP (for retrieval only):
- The Chariot, willpower, victory through discipline, forward motion, self-mastery

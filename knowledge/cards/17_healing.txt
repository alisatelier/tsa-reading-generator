CARD ID: 17
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): Healing
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): The Star
ELEMENT: Air

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Healing" (never call it "The Star").
- You may use traditional Star symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "Healing".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Hope, renewal, and gentle restoration.
- Cosmic navigation: guidance returning after confusion.
- Faith in the future built through small, steady steps.
- Soothing the spirit; choosing a brighter direction.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Casting your gaze upwards has been the cure prescribed by centuries of souls who have found themselves astray. If any star can guide your way, the question of which to follow holds an answer of infinite directions. With the night sky as The Universe, our futures are guided by the courses we take. Set your sights on a brighter destination. Have faith that finding your path will be a tale fit for the constellation that leads you.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Remaining lost; hope dimmed or postponed.
- Lured astray by distractions or false guidance.
- Darkness enclosing: discouragement, cynicism, or giving up too soon.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When Healing appears reversed, the sky can feel clouded — not because guidance is gone, but because exhaustion is loud. This can be a season of discouragement, where you doubt your own compass or chase signals that don’t truly nourish you. The invitation is to return to one true star: one value, one practice, one supportive truth you can trust. Your path doesn’t require perfect certainty — it requires gentle consistency.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- You are in a recovery or renewal chapter.
- Your future is opening, but it asks for patience, trust, and steady movement.
- The lesson is to keep choosing the brighter direction, even in small ways.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Choose one “guiding star” for the week (a value like peace, honesty, health, devotion).
- Do one small restorative action daily (sleep, water, walk, journaling, connection).
- Ask: “What direction feels brighter — even if it’s slower?”

PIP: One

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "One of Sparks".
- You may loosely reference its traditional association with Wands for symbolism, but do not rename the card.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Sparks (The Soul): creativity, ambition, dreams, passion projects, dharma, purpose-led work.
2) Add One (Beginnings): infinite potential, a fresh ignition, the first spark before the fire.
3) Translate into the user’s context:
   - What idea is trying to be born?
   - What desire wants a first breath?
   - Where is your soul asking you to begin, even imperfectly?
4) Give one practical next step:
   - Choose one “starter action” that takes less than 30 minutes and creates momentum.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Sparks as the domain (purpose/creative life force).
2) Use One (Reversed): hesitation, stalling at the threshold, waiting for certainty.
3) Name the friction:
   - Fear of failure, fear of visibility, perfectionism, or burnout from trying to begin “too big.”
4) Give one gentle correction step:
   - Make the beginning smaller.
   - Commit to consistency over intensity.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- When it’s supportive:
  - A new idea is alive and viable.
  - Motivation returns when you start, not before.
  - The path opens through movement.
- When it’s challenging:
  - You’re delaying the start because you want a guarantee.
  - You’re trying to begin with a full blaze instead of a single match.
  - You’re outsourcing permission.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What would I begin today if I trusted that the first step can be small and still sacred?

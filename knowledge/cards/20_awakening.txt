CARD ID: 20
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): Awakening
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): Judgement
ELEMENT: Fire

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Awakening" (never call it "Judgement").
- You may use traditional Judgement symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "Awakening".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Reckoning and renewal.
- Final decisions that free you.
- Honest reflection without shame: learning, integrating, choosing again.
- A call to release the past and step into a new chapter.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Look into the mirror. Before you is a reflection of all your past actions. The good you have done, the hurt you have caused and endured looks back at you as you stand at the glass. Relax. Let your shoulders fall. Fortunately, while the past is unchangeable, the future is. Forgive the events that left you with scars. Face the habits that may leave scars on others. Let go. Let go. Let go.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Becoming stuck; difficulty forgiving or releasing.
- No chance to renew because the past is being clung to.
- Feeling trapped in old stories, guilt, shame, or regret.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When Awakening appears reversed, the mirror may feel harsh — as if it only shows what went wrong. But this card is not here to punish you. It is here to liberate you. If shame is keeping you pinned, choose compassion instead of condemnation. Repair what you can. Learn what you must. Then loosen your grip on what cannot be changed. Renewal arrives the moment you stop demanding perfection from your past self.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- You’re at a threshold: a decision, a closure, a turning point.
- You’re ready to integrate the lesson and choose differently.
- The lesson is release: freedom through honest reflection.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Name one thing to forgive (yourself or another), and one thing to change going forward.
- Make one amends action if appropriate (apology, boundary, repair, restitution).
- Write a “new chapter” sentence: “From this point forward, I choose…”

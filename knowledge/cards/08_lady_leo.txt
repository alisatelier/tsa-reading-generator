CARD ID: 8
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): Lady Leo
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): Strength
ELEMENT: Fire

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Lady Leo" (never call it "Strength").
- You may use traditional Strength symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "Lady Leo".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Confidence and courage.
- Gentle power: calm mastery over fear and impulse.
- Steadfast devotion to what matters.
- Turning self-doubt into forward movement.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Radiating self assurity, Lady Leo can tame any fear, can domesticate any distress. She moves innocently, yet gracefully in the pursuit of her passions, and encourages you to do the same. There is no room for hesitation in the manifestation journey with Lady Leo on your side. With gentle strength and steadfast courage, any shortfall can be overcome. May your whispers become roars as you claim your place as a force in this great universe.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Doubting your potential; shrinking back.
- Insecurities manifesting as defensiveness, hostility, or self-sabotage.
- Tactlessness: power expressed without tenderness.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When Lady Leo appears reversed, courage may be available — but self-doubt is interrupting the signal. This can look like playing small, over-explaining, or protecting yourself with sharpness instead of softness. The medicine is steady gentleness: speak to yourself like someone you love, take one brave step anyway, and let confidence be built through action rather than waiting for it to arrive fully formed.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- You are being asked to act from courage instead of fear.
- Confidence is built by doing, not by perfect certainty.
- The lesson is soft power: firm boundaries with an open heart.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Choose one “roar”: one brave act you can do today (send the message, make the ask, begin the work).
- Practice self-respect in small ways (posture, rest, honest words).
- If fear spikes, slow down — then proceed gently, not dramatically.

- In all writing outputs, call this card "Five of Sparks".

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Sparks: passion, ambition, dharma.
2) Add Five (Loss): finding gratitude to heal.
3) Translate: a setback, friction, or “not yet” is shaping you—refining your courage and commitment.
4) Practical step: name what was lost, name what remains, and choose the next action from gratitude (not bitterness).

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Sparks domain.
2) Use Five (Reversed): shock; the fortress is crumbling.
3) Name the friction: sudden disappointment, ego bruise, plan collapse, or conflict around recognition.
4) Correction: stabilize first (rest, reality-check, support), then rebuild with humility and a cleaner plan.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: resilience grows; gratitude reframes the path; conflict reveals what matters.
- Challenging: reactive anger; discouragement; “all or nothing” thinking after a hit.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What is this loss trying to refine in me—and what can I appreciate that still stands?

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Four of Soil".

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Soil: security, assets, stability, what you can hold.
2) Add Four (Manifestation): lead yourself to your dreams.
3) Translate: build secure foundations—save, plan, protect your time/energy, and make your resources support your vision.
4) Practical step: create one boundary or system that protects stability (budget line, savings, routine, space).

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Soil domain.
2) Use Four (Reversed): illusion; your dreams are out of touch.
3) Name the friction: clinging to control, scarcity hoarding, or building “security” that doesn’t actually support your life.
4) Correction: align resources with values—spend/save intentionally, and invest in what truly stabilizes you.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: stability; resource protection; grounded planning; long-term security.
- Challenging: scarcity grip; rigidity; fear-based control; misaligned priorities.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- Where am I holding too tightly, and what would aligned security look like instead?

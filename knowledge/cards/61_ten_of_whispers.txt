NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Ten of Whispers".

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Whispers: stories, perception, conflict, communication.
2) Add Ten (Completion): you have arrived.
3) Translate: a mental chapter ends; a truth lands; a narrative completes and cannot continue as it was.
4) Practical step: accept the ending, extract the lesson, and choose a new thought pattern for the next cycle.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Whispers domain.
2) Use Ten (Reversed): completion, but not in the way you hoped.
3) Name the friction: disappointment, harsh realization, or feeling “done” before you feel ready.
4) Correction: allow grief, then rebuild the story on truth—one boundary, one new belief, one next step.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: closure; truth ends a cycle; liberation through acceptance; new mental chapter begins.
- Challenging: despair narratives; harsh conclusions; bitterness; identity tied to suffering.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What story is complete, and what new story am I willing to live from here?

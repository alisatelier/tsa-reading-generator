HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Whispers: mind, worry, internal conflict, meaning-making.
2) Add Nine (Integration): achievements have unlocked.
3) Translate: your mind is processing intensely; growth requires integrating fear into wisdom, not obeying it.
4) Practical step: reduce mental load—name the worry, check facts, and choose one soothing action.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Whispers domain.
2) Use Nine (Reversed): setback; the strides you’ve gained are lost.
3) Name the friction: anxiety spikes, insomnia, intrusive thoughts, or believing the worst-case story.
4) Correction: return to grounding: sleep, support, simple routines, and one truthful reframe.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: truth-seeking; integrating fear; learning to soothe the mind.
- Challenging: anxiety spirals; catastrophizing; sleeplessness; harsh self-talk.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What is my mind afraid will happen, and what evidence exists for a kinder, truer possibility?

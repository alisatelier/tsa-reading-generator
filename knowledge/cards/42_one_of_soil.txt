NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "One of Soil".
- You may loosely reference its traditional association with Pentacles for symbolism, but do not rename the card.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Soil (The Hands): assets, the self, harvest, tangible returns, material gains, growth, what you can hold in two hands.
2) Add One (Beginnings): infinite potential; a real-world seed with practical promise.
3) Translate: a new material opportunity appears—money, work, stability, health, home, or a tangible next step.
4) Practical step: choose one grounded action that makes it real (budget, plan, purchase, application, habit).

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Soil as the domain (resources + embodiment).
2) Use One (Reversed): hesitation; the journey must begin.
3) Name the friction: scarcity fear, procrastination, undervaluing yourself, or waiting to feel “ready.”
4) Correction: make the first step smaller; prioritize one practical move you can complete this week.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: new opportunity; stability seed; practical momentum; embodied yes.
- Challenging: delays; scarcity mindset; missing a simple next step; under-committing.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What tangible seed is in front of me, and what is the simplest step to plant it?

SPREAD KEY: pphao
SPREAD NAME: Past • Present • Hidden Issues • Advice • Outcome

Purpose:
- A clear, practical read that shows what shaped this, what’s true now, what’s influencing things beneath the surface,
  what to do next, and the likely outcome if you follow the current pattern.

Positions:
1) Past
- What set this situation in motion.
- The pattern or history shaping the current moment.
- What is ready to be released, forgiven, or understood differently.

2) Present
- What is active now.
- The emotional/energetic “weather” of the situation.
- What you can influence today (the lever you can actually pull).

3) Hidden Issues
- What is influencing the situation that is not fully visible yet (internal or external).
- Unspoken needs, fears, assumptions, pressure, or dynamics operating in the background.
- The “quiet truth”: what becomes obvious when you slow down and get honest.

4) Advice
- The most supportive next step you can take.
- A practical action, boundary, conversation, or mindset shift that reduces friction.
- What helps you stay aligned with your values and self-respect.

5) Outcome (directional)
- The most likely direction if nothing changes (not fate).
- What this tends to become if you continue on the current trajectory.
- The lesson or growth edge this path is trying to teach.
- A practical note on how to improve the outcome (one small steering action).

Rules:
- Never speak in absolutes. Outcomes are directional, not guaranteed.
- Don’t mind-read; focus on patterns, needs, and choices.
- Offer agency: “if you choose X, you may experience Y.”
- Keep it grounded and actionable: 1–3 specific next steps.
- End with practical advice + one journal prompt.

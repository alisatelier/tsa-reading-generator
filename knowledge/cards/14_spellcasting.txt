CARD ID: 14
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): Spellcasting
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): Temperance
ELEMENT: Fire

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Spellcasting" (never call it "Temperance").
- You may use traditional Temperance symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "Spellcasting".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Alchemy: blending elements to create a better outcome.
- Trial and error; patient refinement.
- Moderation and timing: doing the right amount at the right time.
- A disciplined craft that turns intention into manifestation.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Any seasoned spellcaster knows that the conditions under which a spell is cast must be pristinely tended for a spell to set. The timing and intent at minimum must be curated meticulously to achieve the desired outcome. When we write our grimoires, we alchemize and adjust our practice to uncover the perfect craft for every spell. Allow this process of conjuring and bewitchment to be a crucible forging new enchantments, and providing you with a means to manifestation.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Misused magic; effort applied in the wrong places.
- Excessive attention; over-tinkering or forcing results.
- Tipping the scales; lack of long-term vision or imbalance in inputs.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When Spellcasting appears reversed, the ingredients may be right — but the balance is off. This can look like rushing the timing, obsessing over details, or pouring energy into one area while another quietly collapses. The invitation is to return to clean craft: simplify the spell, refine the intention, and tend the conditions. Your magic is real, but it works best when it is steady, measured, and aligned.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- You’re in a refining season: adjusting routines, habits, relationships, or a creative process.
- Small improvements compound; consistency is the magic.
- The lesson is balance: patience + practice + right timing.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Choose one variable to adjust this week (sleep, schedule, boundaries, focus time, communication).
- Aim for “just enough” effort — not too little, not too much.
- Write your grimoire note: one lesson learned + one adjustment to try next.

CARD ID: 2
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): The Enchantress
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): The High Priestess
ELEMENT: Water

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "The Enchantress" (never call it "The High Priestess").
- You may use traditional High Priestess symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "The Enchantress".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Inner knowing and intuitive clarity.
- Secrets revealed through stillness.
- Trusting what you sense before you can prove it.
- Wisdom without force: guidance that doesn’t dictate.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Within the silence, you will finally be able to hear. The voice of our own knowing is a whisper in our psyche. The voice of our desires? A wail. The Enchantress will offer wisdom, but is wise enough to omit a direction. If we constantly look to others for this (even to those as exalted as The Enchantress herself) we will forever be lost along the paths they lead us towards and not the path we know to be true. The words of your inner wisdom will come to you in whispers. Be careful not to speak over its message.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Ignoring the inner voice; outsourcing your certainty.
- Being led astray by noise, opinions, or validation-seeking.
- Confusing desire, anxiety, or fantasy for true intuition.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When The Enchantress appears reversed, the message is still there — but something is drowning it out. This can look like asking everyone what you should do, scrolling for reassurance, or forcing an answer before it’s ready. Your intuition doesn’t shout; it repeats. Create a small pocket of quiet and ask one clean question. Then listen for the whisper that returns again and again.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- You already know more than you’re admitting.
- Clarity comes through stillness, not pressure.
- The next step is to trust your internal compass and reduce outside noise.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Take 10 minutes of silence (no phone, no input) and ask: “What do I know to be true?”
- Write the first 3 sentences that arrive without editing.
- If you’re seeking validation, pause and ask: “What am I afraid will happen if I trust myself?”

PIP: One

CORE THEME:
- A beginning. A seed. The first step.
- Raw potential before proof exists.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Beginnings; the potential is infinite.
- A clean opening, a new idea, a fresh emotional start, a practical seed, or a mental truth.
- This is the “yes, it can begin” energy.

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- Look for the smallest real-world action that starts the cycle.
- Treat this as an invitation to commit—gently but clearly.
- Ask: What wants to be born here? What is the simplest version of starting?

REVERSED MEANING:
- Hesitation; the journey must begin.
- Delays, fear of imperfection, waiting to feel ready, or not claiming the opportunity.
- Potential exists, but it’s not being used.

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Identify the fear behind the delay (failure, judgment, success, responsibility).
- Reduce the first step until it’s doable within 10–20 minutes.
- Ask: What would starting look like if I didn’t need certainty first?

MICRO-ACTION:
- Choose one small action you can complete today that marks “day one.”

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What is the seed in front of me, and what is one tiny step that plants it?

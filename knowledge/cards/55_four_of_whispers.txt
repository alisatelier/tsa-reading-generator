HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Whispers: mind, mental load, communication, conflict processing.
2) Add Four (Manifestation): lead yourself to your dreams.
3) Translate: mental restoration is required; you manifest better when your mind is rested and clear.
4) Practical step: schedule quiet—reduce input, pause conflict, and let your thoughts settle.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Whispers domain.
2) Use Four (Reversed): illusion; your dreams are out of touch.
3) Name the friction: exhaustion distorting perception, doom-scrolling, or trying to “think your way out” without rest.
4) Correction: stop consuming information; sleep, move your body, and return to the issue with a calmer mind.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: rest; mental reset; clarity returns through quiet.
- Challenging: burnout thinking; distorted perception; rest avoidance.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What becomes clear when I stop trying to solve it and allow my mind to rest?

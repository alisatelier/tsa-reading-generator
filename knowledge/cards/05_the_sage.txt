CARD ID: 5
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): The Sage
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): The Hierophant
ELEMENT: Earth

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "The Sage" (never call it "The Hierophant").
- You may use traditional Hierophant symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "The Sage".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Wisdom earned through experience and tradition.
- Learning, teaching, mentorship, and ceremony.
- Turning the past into guidance for future action.
- Legacy: passing knowledge forward with integrity.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Come into Ceremony. Close your eyes and be. When your thoughts drift to fears, how do you navigate the treacherous waves that follow? What holds power over you, has no power at all when you do not fear its loss. Learning to take your past and translate it into lessons for future action is a valuable skill. The Sage encourages you to create a legacy from the experiences and knowledge you’ve gained. He passes you a scroll. It’s time to start writing.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Blindly following; borrowing beliefs that don’t fit.
- Independence over community: isolating when guidance would help.
- Power trips: gatekeeping, rigidity, or “I know best” dynamics.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When The Sage appears reversed, the question is whether wisdom is guiding you — or rules are. This can be the moment you realize a belief, tradition, or authority no longer fits your life. Or it can be a warning about spiritual or social power being misused: someone (including you) insisting on certainty instead of curiosity. Choose discernment. Honor what is true, keep what is helpful, and release what requires you to abandon yourself.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- You’re being asked to learn, study, practice, or commit to a path.

- The lesson is translating lived experience into wisdom you can apply.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Choose one practice you can return to consistently (daily, weekly, or seasonal).

- Seek wise counsel — but keep your inner authority.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Soil: resources, time, money, stability, the body.
2) Add Two (Choices): intuition will guide the way.
3) Translate: you’re balancing two priorities—income streams, responsibilities, health needs, or practical options.
4) Practical step: choose what is sustainable; build a simple system (schedule, budget, boundaries) to support the choice.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Soil domain.
2) Use Two (Reversed): indecision; blocking the path’s potential.
3) Name the friction: overwhelm, overcommitting, trying to juggle too much, avoiding a practical decision.
4) Correction: simplify—drop one ball intentionally, or set a clear priority order for the next 2 weeks.

- Supportive: adaptability; practical balance; smart juggling; resourcefulness.
- Challenging: overwhelm; financial/time stress; avoidance; scattered commitments.

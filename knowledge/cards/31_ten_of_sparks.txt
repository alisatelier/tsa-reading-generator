HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Sparks: purpose, creative work, ambition.
2) Add Ten (Completion): you have arrived.
3) Translate: a cycle completes—your work has formed into something real; the outcome is here.
4) Practical step: celebrate and then simplify—decide what continues into the next cycle and what ends cleanly.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Sparks domain.
2) Use Ten (Reversed): completion, but not in the way you hoped.
3) Name the friction: disappointment at the finish line, outcome mismatch, or needing to release a version of the dream.
4) Correction: grieve the expectation, extract the lesson, and choose the next chapter with integrity.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: completion; arrival; an outcome solidifies; the dream becomes tangible.
- Challenging: finishing with disappointment; carrying too much; needing to redefine “success.”

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What is complete, what must be released, and what do I choose to carry into the next chapter?

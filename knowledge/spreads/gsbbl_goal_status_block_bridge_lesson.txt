SPREAD KEY: gsbbl
SPREAD NAME: Goal · Status · Block · Bridge · Lesson

Purpose:
- A forward-moving spread that turns a desire into a grounded plan:
  what you want, where you are, what’s in the way, what helps you cross it, and what you’re learning.

Positions:
1) Goal
- What you’re truly aiming for (the deeper desire beneath the surface).
- The most aligned version of the outcome.
- What success looks like in a way that fits your values and capacity.

2) Status
- The current reality: what’s happening now and what resources you actually have.
- What is already working (or trying to work).
- The “truth on the ground” so the plan is realistic.

3) Block
- The main friction point slowing progress (internal or external).
- A constraint, fear, pattern, belief, or practical obstacle.
- What needs to be acknowledged honestly (without shame) to move forward.

4) Bridge
- The most supportive next step that reduces the block.
- A concrete action, system, boundary, or support that makes progress easier.
- The “bridge” is practical and doable within your current life.

5) Lesson
- What this goal is teaching you about yourself.
- The growth edge you’re building (patience, courage, discernment, discipline, trust, etc.).
- How to integrate the learning so the progress becomes sustainable.

Rules:
- Keep it practical: turn insight into 1–3 next actions.
- Avoid moralizing. Blocks are information, not failure.
- Offer agency: “If you do X, you make Y more likely.”
- End with a short plan (next step + one supportive habit) and one journal prompt.

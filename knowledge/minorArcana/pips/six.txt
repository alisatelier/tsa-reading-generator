KNOWLEDGE TYPE: pip_archetype
PIP: Six

CORE THEME:
- Flow, relief, restoration.
- A moment of balance returns.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Epiphany; you are in the flow.
- Momentum improves, things soften, help arrives, or the path becomes clearer.
- A sense of “this works when I do it this way.”

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- Ask: What is working—and how can I repeat it?
- Practice reciprocity: give and receive fairly.
- This is alignment through simplicity.

REVERSED MEANING:
- Conceal; others may seek your knowing.
- Privacy, discretion, or information boundaries are needed.
- Or: hidden dynamics, unequal exchange, something not fully revealed yet.

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Protect what’s tender or in progress.
- Ask: What needs to stay private until it’s stable?
- Clarify terms if support feels conditional.

MICRO-ACTION:
- Choose one “flow action” and one “boundary action.”

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What helps me stay in the flow—and what boundary protects that flow?

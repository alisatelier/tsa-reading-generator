CORE THEME:
- Loss, friction, disruption.
- The moment you realize something must change.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Loss; finding gratitude to heal.
- Grief, disappointment, conflict, scarcity feelings, or ego bruising.
- A turning point: the old way doesn’t work anymore.

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- Don’t bypass the feeling—name it.
- Look for the lesson that restores power: boundaries, honesty, support, self-respect.
- Ask: What is this loss clarifying?

REVERSED MEANING:
- Shock; the fortress is crumbling.
- Sudden disruption, unexpected consequences, or a foundation revealing weakness.
- Sometimes: denial breaks, truth lands, reality demands a new plan.

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Stabilize first. Triage. Then rebuild.
- Ask: What support do I need immediately?
- Choose one small stabilizing step today.

MICRO-ACTION:
- Identify one support (person, resource, routine) and use it.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What is this disruption asking me to change—and what support will help me do it?

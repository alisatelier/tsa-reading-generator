CARD ID: 10
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): The Fates
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): Wheel of Fortune
ELEMENT: Fire

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "The Fates" (never call it "Wheel of Fortune").
- You may use traditional Wheel symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "The Fates".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Turning points and timing.
- Karma, cause-and-effect, and the momentum of choices.
- A cusp of positive change; life shifting into a new cycle.
- Aligning actions now to influence what arrives next.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Luck, is for The Fates. 
Tied by golden cosmic cords, all our actions and interactions are accounted for. To do a good deed is to cause our cords to glow. The Fates in turn reward the brightest of networks with abundance beyond measure, however their delivery often comes on the cusp of change. Do not fear the turn of Fate. If flowing is desired, the glowing must be acquired. Choose your next steps with care.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Repercussions of poor behaviour; consequences catching up.
- Feeling the universe is working against you.
- A reminder to recalibrate: choices, patterns, and integrity matter.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When The Fates appears reversed, it can feel like the wheel is turning the “wrong” way — but often it’s simply revealing the true cost of misalignment. This isn’t punishment; it’s information. Something in the pattern needs to be corrected. Return to clean choices. Repair what you can, release what you can’t, and let your next steps be guided by integrity. The glow can be rebuilt, one decision at a time.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- A shift is underway: timing is active, and momentum is real.
- A cycle is ending and another is beginning.
- The lesson is to move with change instead of fighting it.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Ask: “What pattern is repeating — and what choice breaks it?”
- Make one integrity-based decision today (even a small one).
- Stay flexible: prepare, but don’t cling to one outcome.

KEYWORDS / TAGS:
- timing, turning point, karma, cycles, fate, momentum, change, alignment, cause-and-effect

CORE THEME:
- Completion, culmination, legacy.
- The cycle reaches a peak, and a new cycle prepares underneath.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Completion; you have arrived.
- A chapter closes with tangible results: clarity, stability, closure, fulfillment, or “the end of a season.”
- Completion is not permanent—it’s the turning of a wheel.

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- Ask: What has reached its natural end?
- Celebrate, formalize the lesson, and choose what you carry forward.
- This is a great time for systems, agreements, or rituals of closure.

REVERSED MEANING:
- Completion, but not in the way you hoped.
- An ending feels disappointing, abrupt, or different than expected.
- A necessary conclusion that clears space for truth.

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Let grief be honest, then ask: What truth is being protected by this ending?
- Identify what must be released so the next cycle can begin.
- Choose a clean boundary or a new standard.

MICRO-ACTION:
- Close one loop: send the message, cancel the commitment, finish the task, define the boundary.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What is complete—and what new cycle is quietly asking to begin now?

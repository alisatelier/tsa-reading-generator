SPREAD KEY: fml
SPREAD NAME: Focus • Moving Forward • Letting Go

Purpose:
- A directional spread that clarifies what to prioritize now, how to take the next step with momentum,
  and what to release so progress feels lighter and more aligned.

Positions:
1) Focus
- What deserves your attention right now (the highest-impact priority).
- The core theme that will make the biggest difference if you work with it.
- The “anchor point” that steadies you.

2) Moving Forward
- The next best step: how to progress with clarity and momentum.
- A practical action, mindset shift, conversation, or support to pursue.
- What builds trust in yourself through consistent movement.

3) Letting Go
- What is draining you, distracting you, or keeping you stuck.
- A pattern, belief, attachment, expectation, or habit that can be released.
- What becomes easier when you stop carrying this.

Rules:
- Keep it actionable: translate each position into one real-life step.
- Letting go is not “giving up” — it’s releasing what isn’t aligned or isn’t yours to hold.
- Offer agency: “If you choose X, you may experience Y.”
- End with 1–3 concrete next actions + one journal prompt.

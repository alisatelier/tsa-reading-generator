SPREAD KEY: horoscope
SPREAD NAME: Horoscope / Year-Ahead (Dynamic Zodiac Start)

Purpose:
- A 12-card “zodiac wheel” reading that shows the themes and growth edges across the next 12 sign-seasons,
  starting from the zodiac season you are currently in.
- This is directional, not fate: it shows patterns, opportunities, and what to focus on.

Positions (dynamic):
- This spread always uses 12 cards total.
- Position #1 is the zodiac sign/season of the date the reading is pulled.
- Each next position moves forward through the zodiac in order, wrapping around after Pisces.

Zodiac order (fixed):
Aries → Taurus → Gemini → Cancer → Leo → Virgo → Libra → Scorpio → Sagittarius → Capricorn → Aquarius → Pisces → (back to Aries)

Dynamic mapping rules:
1) Start Sign
- Determine the zodiac sign/season for the pull date.
- That sign becomes Position #1.

2) Sequence
- Position #2 is the next sign after the Start Sign.
- Continue forward until you have 12 positions total.

Position meaning (applies to every sign position):
For each sign/season card, interpret:
- Theme: the main energetic lesson of this season
- Focus: what part of life wants attention or movement
- Support: what helps you thrive in this season (a practical step)
- Watch-out: a common pitfall or overcorrection to avoid (gentle, not scary)

How to conclude:
- Identify 2–4 repeating themes across the 12 cards.
- Name 1–3 “anchors” (habits, boundaries, or practices) that support the whole year-ahead cycle.
- End with one journal prompt and one affirmation.

Rules:
- Never speak in absolutes. This is guidance, not fate.
- Keep astrology references simple and readable (no heavy jargon unless requested).
- Offer agency and choice: “If you choose X, you may experience Y.”
- Keep it grounded: practical actions, self-responsibility, and emotional clarity.

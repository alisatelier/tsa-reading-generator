NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Three of Sparks".

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Sparks: creative purpose and ambition.
2) Add Three (Growth): one must be raised to rise.
3) Translate: expansion requires investment—time, courage, practice, visibility, or support.
4) Practical step: choose one “growth lever” (skill, consistency, outreach, structure) and raise it steadily.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Sparks domain.
2) Use Three (Reversed): agendas; a hidden cost to expand.
3) Name the friction: overcommitting, chasing growth for validation, or expanding without a stable base.
4) Correction: clarify the true price (money/time/energy) and choose a slower, cleaner scale plan.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: growth phase; readiness to expand; investment pays off over time.
- Challenging: misaligned expansion; hidden trade-offs; growth that costs your peace.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What “hidden cost” am I pretending isn’t part of this growth—and what would a cleaner plan look like?

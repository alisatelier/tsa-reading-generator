KNOWLEDGE TYPE: pip_archetype
PIP: Three

CORE THEME:
- Growth through expansion.
- A third element enters: support, collaboration, momentum, or complexity.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Growth; one must be raised to rise.
- Learning, building, connection, creativity, skill growth, emotional expansion.
- Something is developing beyond the private “idea stage.”

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- Ask: What is asking to mature? What needs nurturing, structure, or shared support?
- Collaboration can be beneficial here—feedback, community, co-creation.
- Celebrate progress; it fuels more progress.

REVERSED MEANING:
- Agendas; a hidden cost to expand.
- Growth that comes with strings attached, unclear motives, or an unspoken trade-off.
- Sometimes: taking on too much too soon.

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Clarify roles, expectations, timelines, and energy costs.
- Ask: What is the hidden price of this expansion?
- Scale back to sustainable growth.

MICRO-ACTION:
- Identify one support that would help (mentor, plan, schedule, boundary) and request it.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What part of this wants to grow—and what “hidden cost” do I need to name honestly?

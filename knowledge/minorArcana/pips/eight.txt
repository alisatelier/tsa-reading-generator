PIP: Eight

CORE THEME:
- Transcendence, movement, acceleration.
- You rise by refining, committing, and continuing.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Transcendence; greater heights await.
- Progress speeds up; you gain mastery, momentum, or clarity through repetition.
- The path becomes less theoretical and more embodied.

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- Ask: What happens if I commit for 30 days?
- Choose consistency over intensity.
- This is about evolving beyond old limits.

REVERSED MEANING:
- Stagnation; you have reached a plateau.
- Boredom, burnout, drifting, or repeating patterns without improvement.
- Motion exists, but not meaningful progress.

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Change the approach: get feedback, set a higher standard, reduce distractions.
- Ask: Where am I going through the motions?
- Reconnect to purpose.

MICRO-ACTION:
- Upgrade one habit or practice with a clear metric (time, reps, quality standard).

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- Where am I ready to level up—and what would consistent practice look like for me?

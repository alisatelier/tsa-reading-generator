NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Ten of Soil".

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Soil: legacy, assets, tangible foundations, what lasts.
2) Add Ten (Completion): you have arrived.
3) Translate: long-term stability, home/family foundations, wealth of time/resources, a solid material chapter completing.
4) Practical step: formalize what you’ve built—systems, savings, routines, agreements, or a long-term plan.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Soil domain.
2) Use Ten (Reversed): completion, but not in the way you hoped.
3) Name the friction: instability in family/resources, legacy expectations, or realizing “success” needs redefining.
4) Correction: simplify; return to values; rebuild foundations with clarity rather than appearances.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: legacy; stable foundation; wealth (time/resources); material completion.
- Challenging: instability in foundations; value conflicts; redefining success; pressure around security.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What kind of foundation do I actually want to build—and what value must it be rooted in?

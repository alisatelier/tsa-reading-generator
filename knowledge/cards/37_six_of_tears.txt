2) Add Six (Epiphany): you are in the flow.
3) Translate: emotional ease returns; heart-softening; a sweet reconnection with innocence, nostalgia, or tenderness.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):

- Challenging: oversharing; trust issues; nostalgia that keeps you stuck; unclear emotional boundaries.

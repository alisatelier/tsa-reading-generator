SPREAD KEY: ppf
SPREAD NAME: Past • Present • Future

Purpose:
- A simple timeline read that shows: what shaped this, what’s active now, and the likely direction if nothing changes.

Positions:
1) Past
- What shaped this moment.
- The pattern you’re emerging from.
- What is ready to be released.

2) Present
- What is active now.
- What you can influence today.
- The emotional/energetic weather.

3) Future (directional)
- The likely direction if nothing changes (not fate).
- The next growth edge.
- A practical next step to steer the direction.

Rules:
- Never speak in absolutes. Outcomes are directional, not guaranteed.
- Don’t mind-read; focus on patterns, needs, and choices.
- Offer agency: “if you choose X, you may experience Y.”
- End with practical advice + one journal prompt.

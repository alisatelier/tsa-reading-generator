CARD ID: 13
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): Birth
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): Death
ELEMENT: Water

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Birth" (never call it "Death").
- You may use traditional Death symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "Birth".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- A fresh start through an ending.
- Transformation: one chapter closing so another can begin.
- First encounters, new cycles, renewed identity.
- Embracing impermanence as a sacred doorway.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Miracles. The cycle of life is filled with them, and so too is the spiritual realm. Life itself is a mysterious, magical reality and whether its origins are evolutionary or divine, we can appreciate the privilege of being a part of it. Take this as a sign to live. To not fear endings as they herald new beginnings. To take beginnings as the first breath, and leave the past as a passing. Embrace the miracle. Claim it as your own.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Resisting change; clinging to what has already ended in spirit.
- Obsessing over the past; fear of a new cycle.
- Delayed transformation: avoiding the doorway.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When Birth appears reversed, the new chapter is still available — but something is gripping the old one. This can look like replaying what happened, bargaining with what’s already complete, or trying to keep an identity that no longer fits. You don’t have to rush the transition, but you do have to allow it. Honor what is ending. Then choose one small act that welcomes the beginning.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- A transition is underway, whether chosen or not.
- You are being asked to release what is finished.
- The lesson is to trust the cycle: endings are not punishments; they are passages.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Identify one thing that is complete (a habit, role, belief, relationship pattern).
- Create a simple closing ritual: write a goodbye letter, tidy a space, delete one old draft, return one item.
- Take one “first breath” action toward the new (a single step, not a full leap).

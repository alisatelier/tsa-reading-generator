CARD ID: 1
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): The Enchanter
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): The Magician
ELEMENT: Air

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "The Enchanter" (never call it "The Magician").
- You may use traditional Magician symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "The Enchanter".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Personal power and resourcefulness.
- Inner genius and capability becoming visible.
- Turning intention into action; translating desire into something real.
- Abundance in aptitude: you already have what you need to begin.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Sparks. Tears. Soil. Whispers. An ace of each with an incantation of willpower will raise your desires from the depths of The Universe. The Enchanter may show you the tools, but you were in possession of them from the moment your journey began. What revelation will stir you to realize that every quality you possess is a hidden talent, skill, or secret gift? Which, if given the opportunity to flourish, will assist your dreams and result in manifestations beyond your wildest expectation.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Dormant abilities; underestimating your power.
- Feeling unprepared or “not ready yet.”
- Becoming hoodwinked: distraction, self-doubt, or outside influence dimming your confidence.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When The Enchanter appears reversed, it can feel like the tools are just out of reach — but more often, they’re already in your hands and you don’t believe you’re allowed to use them. This is a call to reclaim your capability. Beware of shiny distractions, borrowed opinions, or inner narratives that insist you must wait. Your magic doesn’t arrive later. It strengthens when you practice it now.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:

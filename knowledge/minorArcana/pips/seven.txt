CORE THEME:
- Resilience, tests, strategy.
- The path asks for endurance and discernment.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Resilience; adversity must be overcome.
- Challenge builds strength; obstacles reveal what you’re made of.
- A lesson in persistence, strategy, and self-trust.

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- Ask: What is this testing in me—discipline, courage, integrity, patience?
- Choose steady progress over dramatic leaps.
- Use discernment; not everyone deserves access.

REVERSED MEANING:
- Resistance; adversity must be overcome.
- Pushing against the lesson, refusing the truth, avoiding effort, or fighting the wrong battle.
- Sometimes: self-sabotage disguised as “logic.”

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Identify where you’re leaking energy (overexplaining, procrastinating, people-pleasing).
- Ask: What battle am I fighting that isn’t mine?
- Return to the simplest next step.

MICRO-ACTION:
- Pick one obstacle and design a small, repeatable plan to face it.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What is this challenge trying to strengthen in me—and what is one steady action I can repeat?

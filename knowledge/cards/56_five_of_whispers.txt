HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Whispers: conflict, language, perception, stories.
2) Add Five (Loss): finding gratitude to heal.
3) Translate: a conflict leaves residue—ego bruises, miscommunication, “winning” that costs connection.
4) Practical step: choose integrity over victory; repair what matters and release what doesn’t.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Whispers domain.
2) Use Five (Reversed): shock; the fortress is crumbling.
3) Name the friction: a sudden argument, betrayal of trust, exposure of motives, or a conversation that changes everything.
4) Correction: pause escalation, get grounded, and decide what boundary or repair is actually needed.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: learning from conflict; choosing peace; clean boundaries.
- Challenging: power struggles; harsh words; escalation; ego-driven communication.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What would it look like to choose peace and integrity, even if I don’t “win”?

CORE THEME:
- Structure, foundation, stability.
- Making something real enough to hold.

UPRIGHT MEANING:
- Manifestation; lead yourself to your dreams.
- Building stability: routines, boundaries, systems, resources, a safe base.
- The work of making the dream livable.

HOW TO READ UPRIGHT:
- Ask: What foundation supports my future self?
- Create structure that protects energy, time, and values.
- This is “make it sustainable” energy.

REVERSED MEANING:
- Illusion; your dreams are out of touch.
- A foundation built on fear, fantasy, or avoidance.
- Trying to manifest without structure; or clinging to control that isn’t actually stabilizing.

HOW TO READ REVERSED:
- Reality-check: what’s missing to make this stable?
- Simplify the plan.
- Ask: What foundation would make this real (not just imagined)?

MICRO-ACTION:
- Create one small system: a schedule block, budget line, boundary, or checklist.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What foundation do I need so my dream can actually live in my real life?

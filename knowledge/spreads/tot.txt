SPREAD KEY: this-or-that
SPREAD NAME: This or That (Focus + Pros/Cons)

Purpose:
- A decision spread that compares two options with clarity and compassion:
  what matters most, the benefits and costs of Option A, and the benefits and costs of Option B.

Positions:
1) Focus
- What matters most in this decision (the real priority beneath the surface).
- The value, need, or constraint that should guide your choice.
- The “north star” that keeps you aligned (even if emotions are loud).

Option A:
2) Option A — Pro
- The strongest benefit of choosing Option A.
- What becomes easier, healthier, or more supportive with this path.
- Where Option A helps you grow or stabilizes you.

3) Option A — Con
- The main cost or trade-off of Option A.
- What you must be willing to tolerate, release, or work through.
- A friction point, risk, or emotional challenge to plan for.

Option B:
4) Option B — Pro
- The strongest benefit of choosing Option B.
- What becomes more possible, free, or fulfilling with this path.
- Where Option B supports expansion or deeper alignment.

5) Option B — Con
- The main cost or trade-off of Option B.
- What you must be willing to tolerate, release, or work through.
- A friction point, risk, or emotional challenge to plan for.

How to conclude:
- Compare options through the Focus card first:
  “Which option better supports the Focus priority?”
- Offer a decision framework:
  - values alignment
  - capacity and nervous system
  - sustainability over time
  - what you are truly willing to commit to
- If the spread is close or mixed:
  suggest a small experiment (a low-risk trial step) to gather real-world clarity.

Rules:
- Do not declare a single “correct” choice.
- Do not speak in absolutes. This is guidance, not fate.
- Keep it grounded and actionable: 1–3 next steps for either path.
- End with a gentle journal prompt and a simple affirmation.

CARD ID: 11
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): The Scales
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): Justice
ELEMENT: Air

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "The Scales" (never call it "Justice").
- You may use traditional Justice symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "The Scales".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Truth, fairness, and consequence.
- Balance restored through honest accounting.
- Integrity: alignment between actions, values, and outcomes.
- Decisions made with clarity, not emotion or manipulation.

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
Fair must remain fair or else The Scales will tip. When equality veers into injustice, we can expect an adjustment to bring The Scales back into balance. Rewards and consequences will be dealt in logical hands, and no act of bribery or manipulation can change the outcome. What is fair may not be what is desired, but it ensures that no accumulation of abundance leaves the other bowl bereft.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- The gravity of grievances; resentment building.
- Inequity left uncorrected; imbalance tolerated too long.
- Unfavourable favouritism; unclear standards or biased dynamics.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When The Scales appears reversed, something feels uneven — and your spirit knows it. This can be a sign that boundaries are too soft, expectations are unclear, or fairness has been postponed in the name of keeping peace. It can also point to distorted standards: judging yourself harshly while excusing others, or accepting crumbs where you deserve equity. The invitation is to correct the imbalance with clean honesty. Name what is true, then choose what is fair.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- A decision is required — one that respects truth and consequence.
- You are being asked to act with integrity, even if it’s uncomfortable.
- The lesson is fairness: clear standards, honest boundaries, and equal exchange.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Ask: “Where is the exchange uneven — time, effort, care, money, respect?”
- Make one boundary or request that restores balance.
- Choose clarity over persuasion: state facts, not just feelings.

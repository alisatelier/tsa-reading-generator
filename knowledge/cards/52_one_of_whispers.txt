- You may loosely reference its traditional association with Swords for symbolism, but do not rename the card.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Whispers (The Mind): intellect, communication, intended messages, interactions, inner journeys, conflict.
2) Add One (Beginnings): infinite potential; the first clear thought; the start of truth.
3) Translate: a mental breakthrough, clarity, or a truth wants to be spoken.
4) Practical step: name the truth in one sentence and take one clean action that aligns with it.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Whispers as the domain (thought + communication).
2) Use One (Reversed): hesitation; the journey must begin.
3) Name the friction: avoiding a conversation, overthinking, fear of conflict, or withholding truth.
4) Correction: start small—draft the message, ask one question, or speak one honest line.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: clarity; truth arrives; decisive communication; mental reset.
- Challenging: avoidance; rumination; fear of speaking; delayed decision.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What truth am I ready to name plainly, even if it changes my next step?

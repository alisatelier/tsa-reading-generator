CARD ID: 6
CANONICAL TSA NAME (always use this name in the reading): The Beloved
RWS EQUIVALENT (reference only; do not name it in the reading): The Lovers
ELEMENT: Air

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "The Beloved" (never call it "The Lovers").
- You may use traditional Lovers symbolism internally, but the public-facing name must remain "The Beloved".

CORE MEANING (UPRIGHT SUMMARY):
- Desire, attraction, and meaningful choice.
- Following what calls you — with discernment.
- A turning point: choosing alignment over convenience.
- Affection beyond romance (people, paths, projects, values).

UPRIGHT (ALI BIRD VOICE):
That which pulls at your attention, and claims your desire is The Beloved. If a person, place, item, idea is darling to you then it has declared its place on your path. The Beloved is intended to be chased, though the catch may be elusive. The choice is yours to allow such magnetism to sway you from your trajectory, knowing that it may lead you on an unfruitful detour. Should the fruit be yours to taste, however, you will not bite into a sweeter reward.

REVERSED (SUMMARY):
- Elusive obtainment; hoops to jump through.
- Dependency, attachment, or chasing what does not choose you back.
- Confusion between desire and alignment; temptation without integrity.

REVERSED (ALI BIRD VOICE):
When The Beloved appears reversed, desire may be leading the mind more than the soul. This can look like chasing, bargaining, over-investing, or trying to earn what should be freely offered. It can also show up as attachment to an idea that once felt sweet, but no longer nourishes you. The invitation is to choose with integrity: let desire be a signal, then ask if the path is mutual, sustainable, and aligned with your values.

WHEN THIS CARD SHOWS UP:
- A choice is asking to be made (in love, work, identity, or direction).
- You are being pulled by something magnetic — and discernment is required.
- The lesson is alignment: choosing what matches your values, not just your craving.

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Ask: “Is this desire leading me toward myself — or away from myself?”
- Choose one value (honesty, stability, growth, peace) and use it as your compass.
- If this is about a person: look for reciprocity, not intensity.

KEYWORDS / TAGS:
- desire, choice, alignment, attraction, values, devotion, reciprocity, temptation, turning point

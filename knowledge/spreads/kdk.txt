SPREAD NAME: What I Know • What I Don’t Know • What I Need To Know

Purpose:
- A clarity read that separates what’s already true/available, what’s uncertain or hidden, and what information,
  question, or insight will create the biggest breakthrough next.

Positions:
1) What I Know
- What is already true, visible, or confirmable right now.
- The facts, patterns, and signals you can trust.
- What you’re correctly sensing (even if you doubt yourself).

2) What I Don’t Know
- What is missing, unclear, or not fully revealed yet.
- Blind spots, assumptions, or information you don’t have access to right now.
- What you may be projecting, avoiding, or misinterpreting.

3) What I Need To Know
- The key insight or truth that will unlock the next step.
- The question to ask, the boundary to name, or the detail to confirm.
- The “next right step” for clarity (practical and actionable).

Rules:
- Keep it grounded: distinguish between what is observable vs. what is speculative.
- Don’t mind-read; focus on what can be clarified through conversation, evidence, or self-honesty.
- Offer agency: “If you do X (ask, confirm, observe, pause), you can learn Y.”
- End with 1–3 concrete next actions + one journal prompt.

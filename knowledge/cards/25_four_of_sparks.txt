NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Four of Sparks".

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Sparks: calling, creativity, purpose-led work.
2) Add Four (Manifestation): lead yourself to your dreams.
3) Translate: create a container that makes the dream real—structure, schedule, space, routine, boundaries.
4) Practical step: choose one stabilizing ritual (weekly plan, creative block, accountability, “done list”).

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Sparks domain.
2) Use Four (Reversed): illusion; your dreams are out of touch.
3) Name the friction: fantasy without structure, skipping steps, or relying on motivation alone.
4) Correction: ground the dream into one measurable milestone and one weekly habit.

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: momentum becomes real; your work has a home; stability supports creativity.
- Challenging: chasing a vision without scaffolding; unrealistic timelines; poor follow-through.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What structure would make my dream easier to live inside, not just imagine?

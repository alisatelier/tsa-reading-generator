PIP: Eight

NAMING RULE:
- In all writing outputs, call this card "Eight of Whispers".

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (UPRIGHT):
1) Start with Whispers: thoughts, perception, inner conflict.
2) Add Eight (Transcendence): greater heights await.
3) Translate: mental constraints can be transcended; the “trap” is often a belief, not a cage.
4) Practical step: identify the limiting thought and replace it with one actionable truth.

HOW TO READ THIS CARD (REVERSED):
1) Keep Whispers domain.
2) Use Eight (Reversed): stagnation; you have reached a plateau.
3) Name the friction: rumination loops, learned helplessness, or staying in a story that keeps you stuck.
4) Correction: take one external action that proves the mind is not the boss (ask for help, make the call, change the plan).

QUICK SIGNALS:
- Supportive: liberation through clarity; breaking mental loops; choice returns.
- Challenging: rumination; self-limiting beliefs; paralysis; feeling trapped.

JOURNAL PROMPT:
- What belief is keeping me in a cage—and what is one action that proves it isn’t true?
